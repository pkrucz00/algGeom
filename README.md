# Algorytmy Geometryczne (Computational Geometry)
Code and reports from course "Algorytmy Geometryczne", 3-rd semester, sophmore year, 2020/21

## About
Repository consists of:
* 4 codes with visualization (in notebooks) and reports on:
    1. [Determinants](https://github.com/pkrucz00/algGeom/tree/master/cw1)
    2. [Convex Hulls (Jarvis and Graham with time tests)](https://github.com/pkrucz00/algGeom/tree/master/cw2)
    3. [Triangulation of Y-monotone polygons and Vertices Alignment](https://github.com/pkrucz00/algGeom/tree/master/cw3)
    4. [Line Segment Intersection](https://github.com/pkrucz00/algGeom/tree/master/cw4)
* Project on **Orthogonal Range Searching** - made with Łukasz Dubiel - [external repository](https://github.com/pkrucz00/projektGeometryczne) consisting of:
    * code of both data structures
    * visualization
    * documentation
    * presentation on the topic
* `geometria.ipynb` - software for visualization made by mgr Krzysztof Podsiadło - basis for visualization in this project
